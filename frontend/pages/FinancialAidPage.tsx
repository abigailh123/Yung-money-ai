                        The Development Bank of St. Kitts and Nevis is the main place for student loans. They offer financing for tuition, books, and even living expenses. Commercial banks also offer loans, but Development Bank often has better terms for students.

                        Both are FREE MONEY for college! In SKN, look for government scholarships from the Ministry of Education. <span className="font-bold">Grants</span> are usually based on financial need. <span className="font-bold">Scholarships</span> are based on meritâ€”like good grades, sports, or community service.

                    <InfoCard icon={<SearchIcon />} title="Where to Find Scholarships">
                        Look everywhere! Start with the Ministry of Education's website. Also, check with local companies, credit unions, and community groups (like Rotary or Lions clubs) as they often give out annual scholarships.

                    <InfoCard icon={<FileTextIcon />} title="Understanding Loan Terms">
                        A loan is borrowed money you must pay back with interest. Before you sign, understand the interest rate, the repayment period (how long you have to pay it back), and if payments are deferred (paused) while you're in school.
